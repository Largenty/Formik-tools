## My settings for getting started with a brand new project !

In first this app have been created with npx create-react-app

# Package installed :
- node-sass
- react-router-dom
- typescript
- env-cmd
- express

# NVM version :
For this project you need to downgrade your node version to 14 min.
use :
nvm use 14

# Env file :
Here some file are listed in the .gitignore file, but you can create the two other files who need:
.prod.env
.qa.env

I'm listening for advice :) !

Enjoy it ! :)
